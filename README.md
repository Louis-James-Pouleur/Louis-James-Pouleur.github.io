# WEBII - Front-end - CarharttAPI üë®‚Äçüíª

```
For WEBII we had to make a website from scratch using a database and design it.
Because I'm a big fan of Carhartt WIP I wanted to make a lookbook where u can 
inspire urself on different styles, and add your own style to it to be shared with 
others.
